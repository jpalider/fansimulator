
Simulation issues:

 - adjusting parameters:
 	* link capacity
 	* AFL length
 	* PFQ length
 	* MBAC algorithm
 	* traffic generators
 	* FRmin, PLmax
 - link utilization, packet loss and packet delay depending on PFQ length and/or MBAC algorithm
 	* the longer the buffer the more packets get transmitted (utilization increases) but suffer longer delay
 	* on the other hand elastic flow can wait longer - is it really a problem?
 - test various thresholds for fair_rate and peak_rate
 - proper traffic generation -> user traffic <-> PL <-> 1% link capacity
 - Results collector should measure:
 	* if prioritized flows (of low peak rate) get dropped
 - short term burst may no be added to PFL (10% probability of accepting a new flow) ->AJ
 - methods of checking whether streaming packets suffer delay
 - showing differences between PFQ and FIF0 with and without MBAC each
 - FIFO and MBAC -> we do not want to restrict packets by queue size, those from AFL get into thanks to MBAC
 -ask Profesor Jajszczyk about source code.
 
 
Scenarios:
 - Almost Saturate link and then test behaviour of new flows
 	* elastic
 	* streaming
 - Observe behaviour of PFQ and link around link saturation -> global scope
 - Real traffic generator
 	* http
 	* ftp
 	* voip
 - Links' size
 
 Scenario 1:
 2 Servers: 1 source and 1 destination server
 Nearly saturated link - check if everything is alright
 
 Scenario 2:
 2 Servers: 1 source and 1 destination server
 Saturated link, and after few second we add new flows
 
 Scenario 3:
 20 flows - each is 128kbit/s, capacity 2560kbit/s - minFR = 128kbits - check if all flows are serviced 
 properly and their service time is at minimum and equal among flows.
 
 Scenario 4:
 Scenario 3 + add 1 new flow (it should be rejected).
 
 Scenario 5:
 3 big elastic flows that take whole link capacity. After that we add 1 new flow (stream or elastic - 2 scenarios)
 and check if they are serviced by server and have lower service time (in case of stream flows).
 
 Scenario 6:
 1 flow exceeding Max PL - check if it is limited to this PL. (check PL and its definition)
 
 Scenario 7:
 Check different queue sizes and link utilization
