	\section{Running \emph{FAN simulator} v.1.0}
	
	The very first step to use \emph{FAN simulator} is to get it. The most common
	way to do that is to download either source code from the project site under
	svn control at \emph{https://fansimulator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk} or the
	.jar packages that contain all necessary libraries to run the application
	succesfully under both Windows or Linux -- each package is prepeared for one of
	the operating systems.	
	
	\emph{FAN simulator} has been written with portability in mind. That is why
	Java has been chosen as programming language. Despite that, there are certain
	requirements that must be met. First of all, JVM~6.0 must be available, Java
	native algorithms in versions 5.0 and 6.0 seem to behave different thus making
	it impossible to work\footnote{In some configurations the application
	simply crashes} stable.\\
	For executable packages nothing but JVM is needed. However, to build and run
	the application from sources following packages must be available\emph{(some
	older versions should also work but were not tested)}:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item {SWTv3.3.2 for target platform}
	\item {jcommon v1.0.10}
	\item {jfreechart v1.0.6}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\section{User manual}
	This section will describe all the functionality that GUI of \emph{FAN
	simulator} provides. It will show how to deal with the applicaion and guide
	through all the windows and sub-windows that might be displayed to the user
	while working with \emph{FAN simulator}.
	Blue rectangles on screenshots with corresponding numbers were postprocessed
	to easier identify graphical objects.\\	
	A group of simulation parameters that control simulation behaviour will be
	called simulation scenario, or simply scenario. There are two ways of setting
	simulation scenario. One is by creating an \emph{.xml} file containing
	necessary information enclosed by XML tags and then loading it or by creating
	the scenario from within \emph{FAN simulator} application. 
	The primary task while constructing a simulating scenario is to define at
	least two servers (one server works but gives no results) which are
	going to participate in packet transmission, set a link between them (actualy
	a one-way interface to the destination server), configure FAN router paramerts
	and creating a traffic generator adjacent to a server.
	
   \subsection{Creating scenario file manually}

    Here is a skeleton of a minimal scenario file. The listing below can be
    easily generated from GUI, at this point, however, its structure is 
   being described.
    \begin{verbatim}

 1.   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 2.   <root>
 3.      <description>
 4.          This is a sample description for non-existing scenario.
 5.          It can span over several lines and theoretically be as
 6.          long as necessary!
 7.      </description>
 8.      <server n="Server nr 1">
 9.          <interface	 bandwidth="320000"
10.                      maxFlowListSize="25"
11.                      maxPL="0.1"
12.                      minFR="16000"
13.                      peer="Server nr 2"
14.                      probability="1.0"
15.                      queueSize="80000"
16.          />
17.          <generator  type="constant">
18.              <packetSize>400</packetSize>
19.              <startTime>0.0</startTime>
20.              <flowLowerRange>1</flowLowerRange>
21.              <flowHigherRange>20</flowHigherRange>
22.              <looped>true</looped>
23.              <interval>0.00125</interval>
24.          </generator>
25.      </server>
26.      <server n="Server nr 2">
27.          <interface  bandwidth="1" 
28.                      maxFlowListSize="100"
29.                      maxPL="1.0"
30.                      minFR="1.0"
31.                      peer="Server nr 2"
32.                      probability="1.0"
33.                      queueSize="100000"
34.          />
35.      </server>
36.  </root> 

	\end{verbatim}

	Each scenario file should be a properly formatted \emph{.xml} file. Line 1
	consists of a comment including coding type used in that document.\\
	Lines 2 and 36 are the root tags, by convention named \emph{root}. It is
	obligatory to have them in the scenario file.\\
	Lines 3 and 7 denoted as \emph{description} tag enclose some
	additional text, usually a description of a scenario. As this is an XML file
	some characters are forbidden -- XML documentation gives further
	information about that issue.\\
	\emph{Server} tag embracing lines 8-25 sets a server name and describes its
	behaviour. Child nodes that might appear in \emph{server} section can be
	\emph{interface} or \emph{generator}.\\
	The \emph{interface} tag does not have any sub-tags, as all the necessary
	information is represented as attributes of a tag. These are:
	\begin{enumerate}
      \item bandwidth -- bandwidth in B/s of a link from \emph{this} interface
      to the destination server
      \item maxFlowListSize -- the total number of flows kept in FAN router
      \item maxPL -- maximum priority load of a flow
      \item minFR -- minimum fair rate of a flow
      \item peer -- name of a server this interface in liked to
      \item probability -- probability that a packet while being
      statistically routed (no real routing algorithms are implemented) will
      be switched to this interface. A sum of \emph{probability} over all
      \emph{interfaces} on a server must be equal to 1.0.
      \item queueSize -- maximum size in B of a queue that keeps packets
      waiting for trasmission
    \end{enumerate}
    \emph{Generator} tag describes traffic sources. There are four types of
    traffic generators (time values are given in seconds):
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item constant -- packets are sent every \emph{interval} 
      \item uniform -- packets are sent in various intervals between
      \emph{StartRange} and \emph{EndRange}
      \item normal -- packets are sent in time spaces accordingly to Gaussian
      distribution configured with \emph{mean} and \emph{variance}. 
      \item basic -- TODO
    \end{enumerate}
    Apart from specyfic parameters of generators' types, there are a few
    additional one:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item packetSize -- defines a size of every generated packet, does not
      change for particular simulation
      \item startTime -- specifies where a generator starts creating packets
      \item stopTime (optional) -- if a generator is to stop at a particular
      point in time, this field should be set. By default packets are generated
      from \emph{startTime} till the simulation end.
      \item flowLowerRange -- with \emph{flowHigherRange (see below)} defines a
      range of flow identifiers that are randomly generated. If there is a need
      to generate packets with exaclty one flow identifier,
      \emph{flowLowerRange} should be equal to \emph{flowHigherRange}
      \item flowHigherRange -- see \emph{flowLowerRange}
      \item looped -- must be true if \emph{stopTime} is not set 
    \end{enumerate}
    Notice: locally serviced packets are immediadely removed from server, thus
    if for a local interface (looping to the server an interface is assigned to)
    \emph{probability} in line 32 is set to 1.0 \emph{bandwidth} may be set to
    any integer value, here 1 as in line 27.

	\subsection{Main window}
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=150mm]{man/MainWindow.eps}
	\caption{Main FAN simulator window}
	\label{MAINWINDOW}
	\end{figure}

	Figure \ref{MAINWINDOW} presents the main window of an application that is
	displayed to the user after start\footnote{Just after splash screen disappears}. It
	consist of a menu bar at the top of the window (0) and the main 
	simulation window. Following objects (group of objects) are visible on the main
	simulation window described with corresponding numbers and their functionality:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item {adds/removes one simulating server -- there should be at least two
	servers to perform simulation properly, of which one used as a drain for
	packets generated on others (and this one as well, but there is no point in
	doing that)}
	\item {text area -- can serve genreal purpose but it is advised for commenting
	a scenario, as reverse engineering from configuration might not give the whole
	picture of simulation aim}
	\item {performs basic test of simulation configuration -- checks if all
	necessary parameters are present}
	\item {starts the simulation}
	\item {defines simulation duration -- represents simulation time in seconds,
	e.g. if there are 10 packets waiting for trasmission and each needs
	100~milliseconds and simulation assumes 1 second duration 10~packets are
	supposed to be transmited }
	\item {pop-ups a subwindow with simulation results -- summarises packets
	statistics}
	\item {pop-ups a subwindow with simulation graphs -- generates a plot
	of simulation results}
    \end{enumerate}
