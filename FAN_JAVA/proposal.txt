
Simulation issues:

 - adjusting parameters:
 	* link capacity
 	* AFL length
 	* PFQ length
 	* MBAC algorithm
 	* traffic generators
 	* FRmin, PLmax
 	* buffer length
 - link utilization, packet loss and packet delay depending on PFQ length and/or MBAC algorithm
 	* the longer the buffer the more packets get transmitted (utilization increases) but suffer longer delay
 	* on the other hand elastic flow can wait longer - is it really a problem?
 - test various thresholds for fair_rate and peak_rate
 - proper traffic generation -> user traffic <-> PL <-> 1% link capacity
 - Results collector should measure:
 	* no traffic periods
 	* if prioritized flows (of low peak rate) get dropped
 - short term burst may no be added to PFL (10% probability of accepting a new flow)
 - methods of checking whether streaming packets suffer delay
 - showing differences between PFQ and FIF0 with and without MBAC each
 - showing behaviour in  ???
 - PFQ and MBAC configuration in config.xml
 - FIFO and MBAC -> we do not want to restrict packets by queue size, those from AFL get into thanks to MBAC
